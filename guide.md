# 📖 Facilitator Guide — iOS Training (Week 1 & 2)

## 🎯 Purpose
This guide ensures consistency across facilitators by outlining:
- **How each day is structured** (time breakdown)
- **How to interact with students** during the live build
- **When and how to introduce stretch goals**
- **How to transition to capstone work**

The **specific topics, demo app steps, and capstone tasks** for each day are already documented in the daily instructions — this is the high-level delivery playbook.

## 🗓 Daily Flow (2-Hour Live Session)

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **0–5 min** | **Recap Yesterday** | Call on 1–2 students to explain what they built and learned yesterday. Keep it brief, but let them do most of the talking. |
| **5–15 min** | **Preview Today** | Show what you’ll be building today in the demo app and how it relates to their capstone. Give a quick run-through of the finished version so they know the end goal. |
| **15–90 min** | **Guided Build — Demo App** | Share your screen, but let students **dictate the code** as much as possible. Ask leading questions like “What should go here?” or “What’s the method we need for that?”<br>Run the app often to show progress.<br>Pause occasionally to explain “why” behind a step. |
| **90–105 min** | **Stretch Goal (Optional)** | If the core goal is complete early, pitch an idea: *“We have 15 minutes left — should we try adding a search bar?”* Let the group decide whether to attempt it. |
| **105–120 min** | **Wrap-Up & Capstone Handoff** | Summarize what was built, call out 2–3 “key takeaways,” and clearly explain the capstone task for the afternoon. |

## 👩‍🏫 Facilitation Principles

- **Student-led coding:** Even though you’re sharing your screen, avoid doing all the thinking. Ask questions so students guide the implementation.
- **Small wins often:** Run the app frequently so they can see progress in real time.
- **Keep momentum:** If students get stuck, help them get unblocked quickly so the group doesn’t stall.
- **Stretch goals are optional:** Present them as “bonus challenges,” not requirements.
- **Core first:** Never start a stretch goal until the day’s core objectives are complete.
- **Flag ideas for later:** If a student suggests something extra, say:  
  *“That’s a great idea — let’s note it for a stretch goal after we finish the main build.”*
- **Consistency matters:** Follow the same structure each day so students know what to expect.

## 🛠 Tools & Resources
- **Charles Proxy** — Use for API mocking, rewrites, and mappings where the real API does not yet exist.
- **Daily Instructions** — Contain the specific topics, demo steps, capstone tasks, and stretch goals for that day.
- **Capstone Project** — Students work on this after the live session, applying the same concepts from the demo.

## 💡 Example Facilitator Prompts
- **Recap:** “Who remembers what our stretch goal was yesterday? Did anyone try it?”
- **Lead-in:** “We’re going to make this tableview a little more dynamic — what’s the first thing we need to add?”
- **Decision Point:** “We have 20 minutes left — do you want to start the stretch goal or refine what we have so far?”
- **Wrap-up:** “In your capstone this afternoon, you’ll be doing the same thing we just built — but with your banking accounts screen.”
