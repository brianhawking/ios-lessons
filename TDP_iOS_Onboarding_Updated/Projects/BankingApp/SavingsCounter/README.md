This project is a simple interest calculator with a counter UI. Users can increase or decrease a deposit amount and see the projected savings after 10 years with compound interest.

## Features
- Increase/decrease buttons to change deposit
- Interest calculation based on fixed rate and time

## Instructions
1. Build a view with:
   - A label showing the current deposit
   - A label showing projected savings after 10 years
   - Increase and Decrease buttons to change deposit

2. Use a simple compound interest formula in your logic:
```
futureValue = presentValue * pow((1 + rate), years)
```

3. Update savings label dynamically as the deposit changes.
